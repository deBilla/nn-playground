## Overview

NN Playground is split into three interactive sections, each targeting a different aspect of machine learning education:

| Section | What it teaches | What's happening |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Neural Network** | How networks learn to classify data | Real backpropagation training on toy 2D datasets |
| **Architecture** | How model layers stack together | Shape inference, parameter counting, layer types |
| **RL Playground** | How agents learn from rewards | Real Q-learning/SARSA on an interactive grid world |

Everything runs client-side. The neural network math is implemented from scratch in ~200 lines of TypeScript — no TensorFlow, no PyTorch, no external ML dependencies.

## Features

### 1. Neural Network Visualizer

This is a TensorFlow-Playground-style experience where you configure a small neural network, pick a 2D dataset, and watch it learn in real time.

#### What you see

- **Network graph (SVG)** — Neurons arranged in columns (input → hidden → output). Each neuron is colored by its activation value (blue = low, orange = high). Connections between neurons are colored and sized by their weight (blue = positive, orange = negative, thicker = larger magnitude).

- **Decision boundary (Canvas)** — A 200×200 pixel heatmap. For every point in 2D space, the network's output is computed and colored. Blue regions = class 0, orange regions = class 1. Training data points are overlaid as dots. Watch the boundary form as the network learns.

- **Loss chart (SVG)** — Tracks MSE loss over training epochs. Should trend downward as the network improves. If it plateaus or oscillates, the network is struggling.

#### What you can configure

| Control | Options | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Dataset** | XOR, Circle, Spiral, Gaussian | Changes the training data distribution |
| **Hidden Layers** | 1-4 layers, various neuron counts | More layers = more capacity for complex patterns |
| **Activation** | ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh | Changes the non-linearity applied at each neuron |
| **Learning Rate** | 0.0001 to 1.0 (log scale) | How aggressively weights update each step |

#### Training controls

- **Play** — Runs continuous training (5 epochs per animation frame)
- **Step** — Advances exactly 1 epoch
- **Reset** — Reinitializes the network with random weights (same architecture)

#### The datasets explained

- **XOR** — The classic problem that proved single-layer perceptrons aren't enough. Points in opposite quadrants share a class. Requires at least 1 hidden layer.
- **Circle** — Inner ring vs outer ring. Tests whether the network can learn radial decision boundaries. Works well with 1-2 hidden layers.
- **Spiral** — Two interleaved spirals. This is the hardest dataset — the boundary is highly non-linear. Needs 3+ hidden layers and patience.
- **Gaussian** — Two gaussian blobs with slight overlap. Nearly linearly separable — even a simple network solves it quickly.

#### What's actually happening

Each training step:
1. **Forward pass** — Every data point flows through the network. Each neuron computes `activation(weights · inputs + bias)`.
2. **Loss calculation** — MSE between the network's output and the true label.
3. **Backward pass (backpropagation)** — The error gradient flows backward through each layer. For each weight, the algorithm computes: "how much did this weight contribute to the error?"
4. **Weight update** — Each weight is nudged in the direction that reduces the error: `weight -= learningRate × gradient`.

The decision boundary updates after every epoch, so you can literally watch the network carve out classification regions in real time.

---

### 2. Architecture Visualizer

This section lets you explore and build neural network architectures visually — like a graphical `model.summary()` from Keras.

#### What you see

- **Architecture diagram (SVG)** — A vertical top-to-bottom flow diagram. Each layer is a colored block showing its type, output shape, activation function, and parameter count. Arrows show data flow between layers.

- **Summary table** — A Keras-style table listing every layer with its type, output shape, and parameter count. Shows total parameters and estimated model size at the bottom.

#### Layer type color coding

| Color | Layer Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Indigo | **Input** | Where data enters. Shape depends on your data. |
| Blue | **Dense** | Fully connected. Every neuron connects to every neuron in the previous layer. Most parameters live here. |
| Green | **Conv2D** | Convolutional. Scans input with small filters to detect spatial patterns (edges, textures). Far fewer parameters than Dense for image data. |
| Purple | **MaxPool2D** | Downsamples by taking the max value in each window. Reduces spatial dimensions. Zero learnable parameters. |
| Amber | **Flatten** | Reshapes multi-dimensional data into a 1D vector. Required before Dense layers when coming from Conv layers. |
| Gray | **Dropout** | Randomly zeros neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Zero parameters. |
| Pink | **BatchNorm** | Normalizes outputs for faster, more stable training. |
| Red | **Output** | Final classification layer. |

#### Preset architectures

**Simple Feedforward**
```
Input [784] → Dense [128, relu] → Dense [64, relu] → Output [10, softmax]
Total params: 109,386
```
A basic network for MNIST digit classification. The input is a flattened 28×28 grayscale image. Two hidden layers progressively compress the representation before the 10-class output.

**Simple CNN**
```
Input [28,28,1] → Conv2D [26,26,32] → MaxPool [13,13,32] → Conv2D [11,11,64] 
→ MaxPool [5,5,64] → Flatten [1600] → Dense [128, relu] → Output [10, softmax]
Total params: 228,234
```
A convolutional architecture. Conv layers detect spatial features, pooling layers downsample, then Dense layers classify. This is the pattern behind most image classifiers.

**LeNet-5**
```
Input [32,32,1] → Conv2D [28,28,6] → MaxPool [14,14,6] → Conv2D [10,10,16]
→ MaxPool [5,5,16] → Flatten [400] → Dense [120, tanh] → Dense [84, tanh] → Output [10, softmax]
Total params: 61,706
```
Yann LeCun's 1998 architecture — one of the first successful CNNs. Uses tanh activations (sigmoid-family) which were standard before ReLU became dominant. Smaller and simpler than modern CNNs but historically groundbreaking.

#### Shape inference

When you edit a layer's parameters (e.g., change Conv2D filters from 32 to 64), all downstream shapes recalculate automatically:

- **Dense**: `output = [units]`, params = `input_size × units + units`
- **Conv2D**: `output = [floor((H - kernel + 2×padding) / stride) + 1, W', filters]`, params = `filters × (kernel² × input_channels) + filters`
- **MaxPool2D**: `output = [H/pool, W/pool, channels]`, params = 0
- **Flatten**: `output = [H × W × C]`, params = 0

#### Editing

- Click any layer in the diagram to select it
- Edit its parameters in the sidebar (units, filters, kernel size, activation, etc.)
- Add new layers with the dropdown + "Add" button
- Remove layers with the trash icon
- All shapes and parameter counts update in real time

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Playground

An interactive grid world where a Q-learning or SARSA agent learns to navigate from start to goal through trial and error.

#### What you see

- **Grid world (Canvas)** — A 6×6 grid. The agent (yellow circle with eyes) moves between cells. Cells can be empty (dark), walls (gray, impassable), goals (green, +10 reward), or pits (red, -10 reward).

- **Q-value triangles** — Each empty cell shows 4 colored triangles (one per direction: up/right/down/left). Blue = positive Q-value (good direction), orange = negative (bad direction). The numbers show the actual Q-values. These fill in gradually as the agent explores.

- **Policy arrows** — Cyan arrows in each cell point in the direction of the best action (highest Q-value). This is the "greedy policy" — what the agent would do if it always exploited its knowledge.

- **State values** — Toggle this to color cells by their maximum Q-value. Green = valuable cells (close to goal), red = dangerous cells (near pits).

- **Episode stats chart** — Plots total reward per episode. The gray line is raw data (noisy because of exploration). The cyan line is a 20-episode moving average — this should trend upward as the agent learns.

- **Algorithm info panel** — Shows the Q-update equation with the actual values from the last step. Lets you see the math happening in real time.

#### How Q-Learning works

The agent maintains a **Q-table** — a number for every (state, action) pair. In our 6×6 grid with 4 actions, that's 6×6×4 = 144 values, all starting at zero.

Each step:

1. **Choose action** (epsilon-greedy):
   - With probability ε: pick a random action (explore)
   - Otherwise: pick the action with the highest Q-value (exploit)

2. **Take action**: Move in that direction (bouncing off walls/boundaries)

3. **Observe reward**: +10 for goal, -10 for pit, -0.1 for empty cells (encourages shorter paths)

4. **Update Q-value**:
   ```
   Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α × [r + γ × max Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
   ```
   - `α` (alpha) = learning rate — how fast Q-values change
   - `γ` (gamma) = discount factor — how much future rewards matter
   - `max Q(s', a')` = best possible value from the next state

5. **Episode ends** when the agent reaches the goal, falls in a pit, or exceeds 200 steps. Position resets to start, but Q-values persist.

Over hundreds of episodes, high rewards propagate backward from the goal through the Q-table. Cells near the goal get good values first, then the knowledge gradually spreads to distant cells.

#### Q-Learning vs SARSA

| | Q-Learning | SARSA |
|---|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Off-policy | On-policy |
| **Update rule** | Uses `max Q(s', a')` — best possible next action | Uses `Q(s', a')` — the action actually taken next |
| **Behavior** | More aggressive, finds optimal path faster | More conservative, avoids risky areas |
| **Near pits** | May learn a path that passes close to pits (optimal but risky) | Learns to keep distance from pits (safer but longer) |

Try running Q-Learning for ~200 episodes, then switch to SARSA and reset the agent. Watch how the learned policy differs, especially near the pit.

#### Hyperparameters explained

| Parameter | Default | Range | Effect |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Epsilon (ε)** | 0.30 | 0 – 1 | Exploration rate. High = more random moves. Set to 0 after training to see the pure learned policy. |
| **Alpha (α)** | 0.10 | 0.01 – 1 | Learning rate. How fast Q-values update. High = fast but noisy. Low = stable but slow. |
| **Gamma (γ)** | 0.95 | 0 – 1 | Discount factor. High = agent plans far ahead. Low = agent is short-sighted, only cares about immediate rewards. |
| **Speed** | 5 | 1 – 200 | Steps per animation frame. Crank to 200 for fast training, set to 1 to watch individual moves. |

#### Interacting with the grid

- **Click any cell** to cycle its type: empty → wall → pit → goal → empty
- The start position (top-left) cannot be changed
- After editing the grid, the agent will adapt its policy to the new layout
- Try creating mazes or multiple pits to see how the agent handles complex environments

## How It Works Under the Hood

### Neural Network Engine

The NN math is implemented from scratch in `src/lib/math/` and `src/lib/nn/`:

#### Matrix operations (`matrix.ts`)

A simple `Matrix` class supporting the operations needed for neural networks:

```
Matrix.multiply(a, b)    — Matrix multiplication (for layer forward pass)
Matrix.add(a, b)         — Element-wise addition (for adding biases)
Matrix.subtract(a, b)    — Element-wise subtraction (for weight updates)
Matrix.hadamard(a, b)    — Element-wise multiplication (for gradient computation)
Matrix.transpose(m)      — Transpose (for backprop gradient flow)
Matrix.elementwise(m, fn) — Apply function to each element (for activations)
Matrix.scale(m, s)       — Scalar multiplication (for learning rate)
```

#### Activation functions (`activations.ts`)

Each activation function provides both its forward function and its derivative (needed for backpropagation):

- **ReLU**: `f(x) = max(0, x)`, `f'(x) = x > 0 ? 1 : 0` — Most common in modern networks. Fast but can "die" (output permanently 0).
- **Sigmoid**: `f(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x))`, `f'(x) = f(x)(1-f(x))` — Smooth 0-1 output. Suffers from vanishing gradients in deep networks.
- **Tanh**: `f(x) = tanh(x)`, `f'(x) = 1 - tanh²(x)` — Like sigmoid but centered at 0 (-1 to 1). Often works better for hidden layers.

#### Layer forward & backward pass (`layer.ts`)

Each layer stores its weights, biases, and caches intermediate values for backpropagation:

**Forward pass:**
```
raw = weights × input + biases
output = activation(raw)
```

**Backward pass (called with the gradient from the next layer):**
```
1. activationGrad = activation.derivative(raw)
2. delta = outputGradient ⊙ activationGrad          (element-wise multiply)
3. weightGrad = delta × input^T                       (how much each weight contributed)
4. inputGrad = weights^T × delta                      (gradient to pass to previous layer)
5. weights -= learningRate × weightGrad               (update weights)
6. biases -= learningRate × delta                     (update biases)
```

Weight initialization uses **Xavier initialization**: `scale = sqrt(2 / (inputSize + outputSize))`. This keeps activations from exploding or vanishing in the early stages of training.

#### Training loop (`network.ts`)

One training epoch:
1. For each data point, run forward pass through all layers
2. Compute MSE loss between output and target
3. Compute output gradient: `2 × (output - target)`
4. Backpropagate through layers in reverse order
5. Each layer updates its own weights during backprop
6. Return average loss across all data points

### Reinforcement Learning Engine

The RL system is in `src/lib/rl/`:

#### Grid world (`gridWorld.ts`)

A deterministic grid environment:
- **State space**: (row, col) positions on the grid
- **Action space**: 4 discrete actions (up, right, down, left)
- **Transitions**: Deterministic — actions move in the expected direction. Hitting a wall or boundary keeps the agent in place.
- **Rewards**: +10 (goal), -10 (pit), -0.1 (empty cell — small penalty to encourage shorter paths)
- **Terminal states**: Goal and pit cells end the episode

#### Q-Learning agent (`qLearning.ts`)

Maintains a Q-table: `number[height][width][4]` — one value for each (state, action) pair.

```
Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α × [r + γ × max_a' Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
                                    ↑ this is what makes it "off-policy"
                                    uses the BEST possible next action
```

The `max` makes Q-Learning off-policy — it learns about the optimal policy even while following an exploratory one.

#### SARSA agent (`sarsa.ts`)

Same Q-table structure, different update:

```
Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α × [r + γ × Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
                                    ↑ this is what makes it "on-policy"
                                    uses the ACTUAL next action taken
```

Because SARSA uses the actual next action (which might be random due to epsilon), it learns a more conservative policy that accounts for the agent's own exploration behavior.

### Key design decisions

- **SVG for network/architecture graphs** — Integrates naturally with React, supports interactivity (hover, click) per element, scales cleanly.
- **Canvas for heatmaps and grid** — Decision boundary renders 40,000 pixels per frame; Canvas is the right tool for pixel-level rendering. Grid world also uses Canvas for per-frame agent animation.
- **Zustand for state** — Lightweight (~1KB), works outside React (important for `requestAnimationFrame` training loops), zero boilerplate.
- **No external ML libraries** — The entire NN engine is ~200 lines. Keeps the bundle at ~250KB (gzipped ~78KB). Also educational — users can read the source to understand the math.
- **requestAnimationFrame loops** — Both the NN trainer and RL agent use rAF loops that read directly from Zustand (outside React render cycle) for smooth 60fps updates without re-render overhead.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:deBilla/nn-playground.git
cd nn-playground

# Install
npm install

# Dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash

npm run preview  # Preview the production build locally
```

---

## Deployment

The app auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` via the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

The workflow:
1. Checks out the code
2. Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
3. Builds the project (`npm run build`)
4. Uploads the `dist/` directory as a GitHub Pages artifact
5. Deploys to https://debilla.github.io/nn-playground/

The Vite config sets `base: '/nn-playground/'` so all asset paths are correct under the GitHub Pages subpath.
